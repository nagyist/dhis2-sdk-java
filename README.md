[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dhis2/dhis2-sdk-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dhis2/dhis2-sdk-java)

DHIS 2 Java Client SDK. Includes implementations for working with typical problems of DHIS 2 client apps (working with data models of DHIS 2, communicating with WebAPI, caching data on device). Some parts of the SDK must be implemented depending on the platform (Android, Desktop, J2ME), so interfaces are provided for things like local storage implementations, network implementations.
